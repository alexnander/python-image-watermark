# python-image-watermark

This project was my submission for Day 84 of the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)


A simple desktop app utilizing tkinter in the Python programming language to place a watermark on an image.

> I did a simple tiling of a simple text alpha composite watermark.  I would like to work on adding font support for font types and sizing, by the results are good enough as is. 

> The one thing I'm proud about with this project is I added a margin to the watermark mask to allow for rotation without having the tiling crop poorly.  Keep an eye out for the "cropping_oversize" variable.
